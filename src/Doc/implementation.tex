Data organization

 xyInfSup:
 theta:
 have the samme fitting data organization (to avoid data copy)
theta[  0:   K-1]: var_x
theta[  K: 2*K-1]: var_y
theta[2*K: 3*K-1]: mu_x
theta[3*K: 4*K-1]: mu_y
theta[4*K: 5*K-1]: w


eta[K,N]: row first ordered


* Pad Processing
+ Notations:
  i, j : indexes for resp. cathode 0 and cathode 1
+ use of the intersection matrix beetween cathode-0 (i) and cathode-1 (j) 
elements to project on one-pad plane
Description: matrix of short row ordered (i*M+j, with i describing rows ans j describing columns)
The final intersection matrix contains 0, ???? 0 index ?

IInterJ and JInterI are compact representations of the intersection matrix to speed the matrix scaning.

* Building the projected pads (projected_xyDxy)
  First the projected pads are built, the new locations are computed with 
  the i-order (cath-0 order). When the cath0-charges of the projected pads
  are computed, it follows the same order than the projected pad 
  building (i.e. the i-order). But computing cath1-charges does not follow 
  the same order (j-order associate with cath-1). The aloneJPads and the mapIJToK 
  are used to get the i-order.
